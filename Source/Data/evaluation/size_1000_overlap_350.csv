It was introduced to ensure that recovery proceedings are initiated only after dues are determined. Over time, amendments empowered various provident fund authorities to conduct inquiries under Section 7A, decide disputes relating to applicability of the Act, and determine amounts due from employers. Authorities exercising powers under Section 7A are required to act judiciously, fairly, and in accordance with principles of natural justice, and inquiries should be initiated only after establishing a prima facie case of default or applicability dispute.","Document 1:

2.1.1 When the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 was framed in the 
year 1952, it did not provide for any forum for determination of dues. Hon’ble Courts had, 
however, held that the action to recover the amount due under the Act, by way of recovery 
proceedings, could be taken only after the determination of dues. Hence, section 7A was inserted 
in the Act, by the Amendment Act 28 of 1963 to remove the above lacuna in the Act, by providing 
a forum to determine the dues under the Act.

parte orders are challenged on this very ground alone. 
 
2.6.3 Even in such cases where ex-parte orders are issued, the officer conducting the inquiry must pass 
a reasoned, fair, and just order. Many a times it is observed that proceedings are conducted in 
undue haste without providing reasonable opportunity to the employer/parties to contest the 
matter and/or arbitrary orders are passed leading to undue litigation and remanding back of 
cases/quashing of orders by higher judicial fora.

material available on record should be exercised only when powers under section 7A (2) have

"What is the scope, procedure, and limitations of review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act?","Review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act is a limited power available against orders passed under Section 7A where no appeal has been preferred. Review may be sought on discovery of new and important evidence, error apparent on the face of the record, or other sufficient reasons strictly construed. Prior hierarchical approval is required before exercising review powers, notice to parties is mandatory, and a review cannot operate as an appeal in disguise.","Document 1:

2. Inquiries u/s 7A, 7B & 7C of the Act 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
The statutory mandate for inquiry under section 7A is two-fold:  
 
 
 
2.1.1 When the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 was framed in the 
year 1952, it did not provide for any forum for determination of dues. Hon’ble Courts had, 
however, held that the action to recover the amount due under the Act, by way of recovery 
proceedings, could be taken only after the determination of dues. Hence, section 7A was inserted 
in the Act, by the Amendment Act 28 of 1963 to remove the above lacuna in the Act, by providing 
a forum to determine the dues under the Act.  
 
2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to

proceedings, could be taken only after the determination of dues. Hence, section 7A was inserted 
in the Act, by the Amendment Act 28 of 1963 to remove the above lacuna in the Act, by providing 
a forum to determine the dues under the Act.  
 
2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to 
recover dues. To simplify and rationalise the process, Section 7A was amended in the year 1973 
empowering the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioner, 
Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to exercise the power under Section 7A. Though there was 
no specific provision in the Act to decide applicability disputes, in various court judgments it was 
held that the assessing authority should first decide the dispute of applicability, if such dispute 
was raised by the employer and then only determine the dues. [D K Barua vs RPFC 1972 I LLJ 385 
(Pat DB); Mahamaya Coconut vs RPFC 1972 II LLN 540 (Ori DB)]
