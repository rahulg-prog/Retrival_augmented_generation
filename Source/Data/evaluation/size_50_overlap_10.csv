What is the purpose of inquiries under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act and which authorities are empowered to conduct them?,"Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 provides a statutory forum for determination of dues under the Act.

Over time, amendments empowered various provident fund authorities to conduct inquiries under Section 7A, decide disputes relating to applicability of the Act, and determine amounts due from employers. Authorities exercising powers under Section 7A are required to act judiciously, fairly, and in accordance with principles of natural justice, and inquiries should be initiated only after establishing a prima facie case of default or applicability dispute.","Document 1:
