"Which establishments are mandatorily covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 and what are the minimum employee thresholds?","The EPF & MP Act, 1952 applies mandatorily to every factory engaged in an industry listed in Schedule-I employing twenty or more persons. It also applies to other establishments employing twenty or more persons as notified by the Central Government. The Central Government may extend the Act to establishments with fewer than twenty employees after due notice. For cinema theatres, the minimum employee strength is five. The Act also applies to establishments employing ten or more persons previously covered under the Jammu and Kashmir Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, effective from 1 January 2020, subject to exemptions under Section 16.","Document 1:
i. To every establishment, which is a factory, engaged in any industry specified in Schedule-I and in 
which twenty or more persons are employed [Sec 1(3)(a)]. 
 
ii. To any other establishment employing twenty or more persons or class of such establishments 
which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf 
[Sec 1(3)(b)]. 
 
iii. Provided that the Central Government may, after giving not less than two months’ notice of its 
intention so to do, by notification in the Official Gazette, apply the provisions of this Act to any 
establishment employing such number of persons less than twenty as may be specified in the 
notification. In case of ‘Cinema Theatres,’ the Central Government has fixed the required 
employee strength at five (5) for the purpose of coverage under the Act. The Central Government 
has also applied the EPF & MP Act, 1952 to all the establishments, employing ten or more persons 
and covered under the provisions of the erstwhile the Jammu and Kashmir Employees’ Provident 
Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, as it stood before its repeal by the Jammu and Kashmir 
Reorganization Act, 2019, with effect from 1.1.2020.

not registering on their own under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 despite being coverable under the Act, 
the RPFC/APFC-in-charge should take immediate steps to contact and persuade such 
establishments for registration through Shram Suvidha Portal. If any such establishment is still not

2.1 Introduction 
 
The statutory mandate for inquiry under section 7A is two-fold:  
 
 
 
2.1.1 When the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 was framed in the 
year 1952, it did not provide for any forum for determination of dues. Hon’ble Courts had, 
however, held that the action to recover the amount due under the Act, by way of recovery 
proceedings, could be taken only after the determination of dues. Hence, section 7A was inserted 
in the Act, by the Amendment Act 28 of 1963 to remove the above lacuna in the Act, by providing 
a forum to determine the dues under the Act.  
 
2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to 
recover dues. To simplify and rationalise the process, Section 7A was amended in the year 1973 
empowering the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioner,

2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to 
recover dues. To simplify and rationalise the process, Section 7A was amended in the year 1973 
empowering the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioner, 
Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to exercise the power under Section 7A. Though there was 
no specific provision in the Act to decide applicability disputes, in various court judgments it was 
held that the assessing authority should first decide the dispute of applicability, if such dispute 
was raised by the employer and then only determine the dues. [D K Barua vs RPFC 1972 I LLJ 385 
(Pat DB); Mahamaya Coconut vs RPFC 1972 II LLN 540 (Ori DB)]   
 
2.1.3 By the Amendment, Act 33 of 1988, the power to conduct inquiry under Section 7A was extended 
to Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioners and Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners 
as well to speed up the assessment of dues and take timely action against defaulters. Provision 
was made expressly empowering officers exercising the powers under this section to decide the 
dispute relating to the applicability of the Act to an establishment, when such a dispute arose. The

2.2.1 Section 7A (1) authorizes the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Additional Central Provident 
Fund Commissioners, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioners, Regional Provident Fund 
Commissioners or Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners to decide disputes regarding 
applicability of the Act to an establishment and/ or to determine amount due from any employer 
under the provisions of the Act/Schemes by order. For the aforesaid purposes, such inquiry as 
deemed necessary may be conducted by the Commissioner deciding the applicability-
dispute/determining amount due.  
 
2.2.2 Section 7A (3) provides that no such order shall be made unless the employer concerned is given 
reasonable opportunity of representing his case. Providing reasonable opportunity before passing 
an order is a requirement of the principle of natural justice. The two core concepts of the principle 
of natural justice are; audi alteram partem  (hear the other side or no one should be condemned 
unheard) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own case).

These officers may decide applicability disputes and determine amounts due after conducting necessary inquiries. No order may be passed without giving the employer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, in line with principles of natural justice. Officers conducting inquiries under Section 7A have powers equivalent to a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including enforcing attendance, examining persons on oath, requiring production of documents, receiving evidence on affidavit, and issuing commissions for examination of witnesses.","Document 1:

The statutory mandate for inquiry under section 7A is two-fold:  
 
 
 
2.1.1 When the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 was framed in the 
year 1952, it did not provide for any forum for determination of dues. Hon’ble Courts had, 
however, held that the action to recover the amount due under the Act, by way of recovery 
proceedings, could be taken only after the determination of dues. Hence, section 7A was inserted 
in the Act, by the Amendment Act 28 of 1963 to remove the above lacuna in the Act, by providing 
a forum to determine the dues under the Act.  
 
2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to 
recover dues. To simplify and rationalise the process, Section 7A was amended in the year 1973 
empowering the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioner,

COMPLIANCE MANUAL 2.2 Officers and their Powers 
                        
2.2.1 Section 7A (1) authorizes the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Additional Central Provident 
Fund Commissioners, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioners, Regional Provident Fund 
Commissioners or Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners to decide disputes regarding 
applicability of the Act to an establishment and/ or to determine amount due from any employer 
under the provisions of the Act/Schemes by order. For the aforesaid purposes, such inquiry as 
deemed necessary may be conducted by the Commissioner deciding the applicability-
dispute/determining amount due.  
 
2.2.2 Section 7A (3) provides that no such order shall be made unless the employer concerned is given 
reasonable opportunity of representing his case. Providing reasonable opportunity before passing 
an order is a requirement of the principle of natural justice. The two core concepts of the principle 
of natural justice are; audi alteram partem  (hear the other side or no one should be condemned 
unheard) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own case). 
 
2.2.3 It is therefore essential legal requirement that reasonable opportunities of hearing be provided to 
the employer and the Central Board is represented by someone other than the officer conducting 
the inquiry.  
 
2.2.4 Section 7A (2) vests the officers conducting inquiry under section 7A (1) with the same powers as

"How are inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C conducted on the Compliance e-Proceedings portal and what timelines apply?","Inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C are conducted exclusively in virtual mode through the Compliance e-Proceedings portal. Officers conduct hearings from their official desktops using dedicated email IDs, while Dealing Assistants manage document uploads, notices, and status updates. Proceedings are recorded, daily order sheets are prepared and shared with parties, documents are filed electronically, adjournments are restricted, and final orders are issued within prescribed timelines.","Document 1:
2.3.3 Conduct of Inquiry 
 
i. Inquiries are to be conducted invariably on Compliance e-Proceedings portal in virtual mode. 
 
ii. The officer conducting the inquiry shall conduct the same from the desktop in his office chamber. 
EO (Departmental Representative) shall attend hearings through desktop available in the office. 
 
iii. SS/SSSA of the Compliance Circle being custodian of the file and records as well as in the role of 
filer in the Compliance e-Proceedings portal shall join the virtual hearing through link from 
desktop in section/office for carrying out following roles: 
 
a. To scan and upload physical documents delivered by any party 
b. To upload final order on the portal after signature of the adjudicating authority 
c. To update the status in each case on portal and follow calendar 
d. To issue notice of hearings, order to parties and other communication through email 
 
iv. Each officer conducting inquiry shall have a dedicated official email id (@epfindia.gov.in) for 
communication with employers and other parties.

through the modes mentioned above, such notices should be served in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; contained in Order V, Rule 9-30 under the First 
Schedule. 
 
v. The summons / notice must be duly stamp marked with the diary number generated on the e-
Proceedings portal besides bearing the sign and seal of the officer conducting the proceeding.  
 
vi. The case diary id number shall be quoted in all communications- Notice of hearings, daily order 
sheets, final orders, orders, and notices in execution process. 
 
2.3.3 Conduct of Inquiry 
 
i. Inquiries are to be conducted invariably on Compliance e-Proceedings portal in virtual mode. 
 
ii. The officer conducting the inquiry shall conduct the same from the desktop in his office chamber. 
EO (Departmental Representative) shall attend hearings through desktop available in the office. 
 
iii. SS/SSSA of the Compliance Circle being custodian of the file and records as well as in the role of

ii. Inquiries under section 7A should only be initiated where there are sufficient and tenable 
reasons for doing so i.e., there is existence of prima facie  case. The Officer initiating the 
32 
COMPLIANCE MANUAL inquiry should record reasons in writing in the file of existence of a prima facie  case based 
on evidence of default/evasion available on record or existence of an applicability dispute 
before initiating process under section 7A. Any inquiry or legal proceeding initiated 
without a prima facie case is of the nature of fishing and roving inquiry and the same is 
impermissible in law    
     
iii. A complaint is merely a source of information; at best, a lead. It does not constitute prima 
facie evidence. Any actionable complaint needs to be verified by the Enforcement Officer 
first and only on substantiation of the same on the basis of evidence collected, any inquiry 
under section 7A should be initiated. Initiating inquiries on the basis of complaints alone 
must be avoided as it is legally untenable.  
 
iv. Proximate nexus with the evidence and period of default available on record should be 
recorded in the file by the officer initiating the inquiry. Initiation of inquiries for prolonged 
periods such as more than 5 years should be avoided unless sufficient documents to do the 
assessment are available on record. 
 
v.  Scope and period of the inquiry should be decided beforehand and once finalized should

"Under what circumstances can an ex-parte order be passed under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act, and how can such an order be set aside?","Ex-parte orders under Section 7A may be passed where a required party fails to attend the inquiry or comply with directions without valid reason, provided due service of notice is confirmed. Such orders must be reasoned, fair, and based on evidence on record. An employer may apply within three months to set aside an ex-parte order by showing non-service of notice or sufficient cause for non-appearance, subject to statutory limitations.","Document 1:
been exercised beforehand. The casefile must show that all possible efforts have been made to 
afford proper and sufficient opportunity to defend the matter by the employer and/or other 
parties involved.  
 
2.6.5 However, where an order u/s 7A (1) has been passed against an employer ex- parte, he may within 
three (3) months of communication of such order apply for setting it aside. If s/he satisfies the 
35 
COMPLIANCE MANUAL officer that the show cause notice was not duly served or that he was prevented by any sufficient 
cause from appearing when the inquiry was held, the officer shall by an order set aside his earlier 
order and shall hear the matter de-novo.  
 
2.6.6 No order shall, however, be set aside merely on the ground that there has been an irregularity in 
the service of the show cause notice if the officer is satisfied that employer did have the notice of 
the date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear before the officer. 
 
2.6.7 Further, if any appeal has been preferred under the Act against the ex-parte order and the same 
has been disposed of, otherwise than on the ground of withdrawal of the same by the appellant, 
no application shall lie under section 7A (4) for setting aside the ex-parte order.  
 
2.6.8 Moreover, no order for setting aside shall be made on an application made under section 7A (4) 
unless notice of it has been served on the opposite party. 
2.7 Review u/s 7B

Document 2:
2.6.2 Confirmation of due service of notice/summons to the employer or any other person required to 
attend the inquiry or to produce any document or to file any report or return should be ensured 
before invoking the provision of section 7A(3A). In many cases it has been observed that the 
employer/complainant has not been aware of the proceeding being conducted. Most of the ex-
parte orders are challenged on this very ground alone. 
 
2.6.3 Even in such cases where ex-parte orders are issued, the officer conducting the inquiry must pass 
a reasoned, fair, and just order. Many a times it is observed that proceedings are conducted in 
undue haste without providing reasonable opportunity to the employer/parties to contest the 
matter and/or arbitrary orders are passed leading to undue litigation and remanding back of 
cases/quashing of orders by higher judicial fora.  
 
2.6.4 It should also be kept in mind that power under section 7A(3A) to proceed with evidence and 
material available on record should be exercised only when powers under section 7A (2) have 
been exercised beforehand. The casefile must show that all possible efforts have been made to 
afford proper and sufficient opportunity to defend the matter by the employer and/or other 
parties involved.  
 
2.6.5 However, where an order u/s 7A (1) has been passed against an employer ex- parte, he may within 
three (3) months of communication of such order apply for setting it aside. If s/he satisfies the

2.6.7 Further, if any appeal has been preferred under the Act against the ex-parte order and the same 
has been disposed of, otherwise than on the ground of withdrawal of the same by the appellant, 
no application shall lie under section 7A (4) for setting aside the ex-parte order.  
 
2.6.8 Moreover, no order for setting aside shall be made on an application made under section 7A (4) 
unless notice of it has been served on the opposite party. 
2.7 Review u/s 7B 
 
2.7.1 In case of review applications filed against orders passed under section 7A (1), the powers under 
section 7B to review the orders shall be exercised by an officer only after obtaining the views of 
the officer next above in hierarchy. APFC of RO/DO shall obtain view of RPFC II (Compliance) of the 
RO/ RPFC I or Officer-in-Charge of the Regional Office (if RPFC II is not there in hierarchy). RPFC II 
of RO will likewise obtain the view of RPFC I of RO or Zonal ACC (in case the RO is headed by RPFC 
II or in case of ROs headed by RPFC I, no RPFC I is posted/available). RPFC I of RO shall obtain the 
view of Zonal ACC. 
 
2.7.2 The scope of review is extremely limited. 
 
2.7.3 Section 7B is a replica of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 and reads as 
under: 
 
7B. Review of orders passed under section 7A .—(1) Any person aggrieved by an order made under 
sub-section (1) of section 7A, but from which no appeal has been preferred under this Act, and who,

",5,Yes,"The retrieved excerpts detail the need for due service of notice and proper opportunity (circumstances for ex-parte) and fully outline the three-month setting-aside procedure with grounds and limitations, but they do not explicitly state the party’s failure to attend or comply without valid reason."
"What is the scope, procedure, and limitations of review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act?","Review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act is a limited power available against orders passed under Section 7A where no appeal has been preferred. Review may be sought on discovery of new and important evidence, error apparent on the face of the record, or other sufficient reasons strictly construed. Prior hierarchical approval is required before exercising review powers, notice to parties is mandatory, and a review cannot operate as an appeal in disguise.","Document 1:
2.6.7 Further, if any appeal has been preferred under the Act against the ex-parte order and the same 
has been disposed of, otherwise than on the ground of withdrawal of the same by the appellant,

2.6.8 Moreover, no order for setting aside shall be made on an application made under section 7A (4)

2.7 Review u/s 7B 
 
2.7.1 In case of review applications filed against orders passed under section 7A (1), the powers under 
section 7B to review the orders shall be exercised by an officer only after obtaining the views of 
the officer next above in hierarchy. APFC of RO/DO shall obtain view of RPFC II (Compliance) of the

from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence 
was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made,

reason, desires to obtain a review of such order may apply for a review of that order to the officer 
who passed the order: 
 Provided that such officer may also on his own motion review his order if he is satisfied that it is 
necessary so to do on any such ground.

within such time as may be specified in the Scheme.

a forum to determine the dues under the Act.  
 
2.1.2 When the Section 7A was inserted, the respective State Governments were empowered to 
recover dues. To simplify and rationalise the process, Section 7A was amended in the year 1973 
empowering the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioner, 
Regional Provident Fund Commissioner to exercise the power under Section 7A. Though there was 
no specific provision in the Act to decide applicability disputes, in various court judgments it was 
held that the assessing authority should first decide the dispute of applicability, if such dispute 
was raised by the employer and then only determine the dues. [D K Barua vs RPFC 1972 I LLJ 385 
(Pat DB); Mahamaya Coconut vs RPFC 1972 II LLN 540 (Ori DB)]   
 
2.1.3 By the Amendment, Act 33 of 1988, the power to conduct inquiry under Section 7A was extended 
to Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioners and Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners 
as well to speed up the assessment of dues and take timely action against defaulters. Provision 
was made expressly empowering officers exercising the powers under this section to decide the 
dispute relating to the applicability of the Act to an establishment, when such a dispute arose. The

What are the mandatory components and structure of a speaking order issued under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act?,"Orders issued under Section 7A must be speaking orders containing not only conclusions and directions but also detailed reasons. An indicative structure includes background of the inquiry, appearance of parties, records produced, submissions of the establishment, department, and complainant, deliberations recorded in daily order sheets, relevant rule provisions, analysis of facts and evidence vis-a-vis rules, findings on each issue, and the final order with month-wise determination of dues and residual amount payable. Such orders must be uploaded on the e-Proceedings portal and are part of the public domain. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}","Document 1:

2.11.7 Quarterly report shall be submitted by the Zonal Office in ST 9 to Compliance Division (Vertical-
IV.9) Head Office for the quarters ending June, September, December, and March of a year by the 
last working day of July, October, January, and April respectively. 
 
2.12 Indicative Structure of the order u/s 7A 
 
2.12.1 The order issued by the Assessing Officer should be a “speaking order”. Speaking order may be 
defined as an order which contains not only the conclusions and directions but also the reasons 
that have led to the conclusions. A speaking order speaks for itself and is considered the third 
pillar of natural justice. It builds up trust and confidence in the system and introduces fairness. The 
requirement of recording of reasons and communication thereof are considered as an integral 
part of the concept of just and fair administrative and judicial procedure and very important facet 
of natural justice. Failure to give reasons could lead to a very justifiable complaint that there was a 
breach of natural justice. Non- speaking order is illegal and against the principle of natural justice. 
 
2.12.2 Accordingly, to ensure that the orders do not suffer from any procedural infirmity, an indicative 
structure is provided below for guidance. It is made clear that the same is for guidance purpose
