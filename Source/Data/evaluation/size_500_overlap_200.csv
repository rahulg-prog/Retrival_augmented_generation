"Which establishments are mandatorily covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 and what are the minimum employee thresholds?","The EPF & MP Act, 1952 applies mandatorily to every factory engaged in an industry listed in Schedule-I employing twenty or more persons. It also applies to other establishments employing twenty or more persons as notified by the Central Government. The Central Government may extend the Act to establishments with fewer than twenty employees after due notice. For cinema theatres, the minimum employee strength is five. The Act also applies to establishments employing ten or more persons previously covered under the Jammu and Kashmir Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, effective from 1 January 2020, subject to exemptions under Section 16.","Document 1:

"Under what conditions can an establishment be voluntarily covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952, and from which date does such coverage apply?","Voluntary application of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 is provided under Section 1(4). Where the Central Provident Fund Commissioner is satisfied that the employer and the majority of employees of an establishment have agreed to apply the Act, the CPFC may, by notification in the Official Gazette, apply the Act to that establishment. An application from the employer is not mandatory; consent of the employer and majority of employees is the essential condition. Coverage under Section 1(4) can take effect only from the date of agreement or a subsequent date specified in the agreement, and retrospective coverage is not permitted. Issuance of notification in the Official Gazette is mandatory, and until such notification is issued, the establishment may withdraw its application.","Document 1:

"How are branches, departments, and related establishments treated for determining coverage under the EPF & MP Act?","For determining coverage under the EPF & MP Act, branches and departments of an establishment are to be clubbed together when calculating employee strength. As per Section 2A, all departments or branches, whether located at the same place or different places, are treated as part of the main establishment.

What is the purpose of inquiries under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act and which authorities are empowered to conduct them?,"Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 provides a statutory forum for determination of dues under the Act. It was introduced to ensure that recovery proceedings are initiated only after dues are determined. Over time, amendments empowered various provident fund authorities to conduct inquiries under Section 7A, decide disputes relating to applicability of the Act, and determine amounts due from employers. Authorities exercising powers under Section 7A are required to act judiciously, fairly, and in accordance with principles of natural justice, and inquiries should be initiated only after establishing a prima facie case of default or applicability dispute.","Document 1:
