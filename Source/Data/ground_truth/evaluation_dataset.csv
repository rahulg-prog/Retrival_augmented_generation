"Which establishments are mandatorily covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 and what are the minimum employee thresholds?","The EPF & MP Act, 1952 applies mandatorily to every factory engaged in an industry listed in Schedule-I employing twenty or more persons. It also applies to other establishments employing twenty or more persons as notified by the Central Government. The Central Government may extend the Act to establishments with fewer than twenty employees after due notice. For cinema theatres, the minimum employee strength is five. The Act also applies to establishments employing ten or more persons previously covered under the Jammu and Kashmir Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, effective from 1 January 2020, subject to exemptions under Section 16."
"Under what conditions can an establishment be voluntarily covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952, and from which date does such coverage apply?","Voluntary application of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 is provided under Section 1(4). Where the Central Provident Fund Commissioner is satisfied that the employer and the majority of employees of an establishment have agreed to apply the Act, the CPFC may, by notification in the Official Gazette, apply the Act to that establishment. An application from the employer is not mandatory; consent of the employer and majority of employees is the essential condition. Coverage under Section 1(4) can take effect only from the date of agreement or a subsequent date specified in the agreement, and retrospective coverage is not permitted. Issuance of notification in the Official Gazette is mandatory, and until such notification is issued, the establishment may withdraw its application."
Does an establishment continue to be covered under the EPF & MP Act if the number of employees falls below the prescribed threshold?,"Under Section 1(5) of the EPF & MP Act, 1952, once an establishment is brought under the purview of the Act, it continues to be governed by the Act even if the number of employees subsequently falls below twenty, or below five in the case of cinema theatres."
"How are branches, departments, and related establishments treated for determining coverage under the EPF & MP Act?","For determining coverage under the EPF & MP Act, branches and departments of an establishment are to be clubbed together when calculating employee strength. As per Section 2A, all departments or branches, whether located at the same place or different places, are treated as part of the main establishment. Additionally, where a common provident fund exists between a coverable establishment and another establishment that is otherwise not coverable, the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, extend the Act to such non-coverable establishment under Section 3."
What is the purpose of inquiries under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act and which authorities are empowered to conduct them?,"Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 provides a statutory forum for determination of dues under the Act. It was introduced to ensure that recovery proceedings are initiated only after dues are determined. Over time, amendments empowered various provident fund authorities to conduct inquiries under Section 7A, decide disputes relating to applicability of the Act, and determine amounts due from employers. Authorities exercising powers under Section 7A are required to act judiciously, fairly, and in accordance with principles of natural justice, and inquiries should be initiated only after establishing a prima facie case of default or applicability dispute."
What powers and procedural safeguards apply to officers conducting inquiries under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act?,"Officers authorized under Section 7A include the Central Provident Fund Commissioner, Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioners, Deputy Provident Fund Commissioners, Regional Provident Fund Commissioners, and Assistant Provident Fund Commissioners. These officers may decide applicability disputes and determine amounts due after conducting necessary inquiries. No order may be passed without giving the employer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, in line with principles of natural justice. Officers conducting inquiries under Section 7A have powers equivalent to a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including enforcing attendance, examining persons on oath, requiring production of documents, receiving evidence on affidavit, and issuing commissions for examination of witnesses."
"What is the procedure for initiation and conduct of inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C of the EPF & MP Act?","The procedure for initiation and conduct of inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C involves submission of an inspection report by the Enforcement Officer through the e-Office system, time-bound processing by compliance officials, examination by the Circle Officer, and registration of approved cases on the Compliance e-Proceedings portal. Inquiries are randomly allocated to eligible officers and supported by a complete investigation report, diary number, summons, and relevant documents forming the basis of the inquiry."
"How are inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C conducted on the Compliance e-Proceedings portal and what timelines apply?","Inquiries under Sections 7A, 7B, and 7C are conducted exclusively in virtual mode through the Compliance e-Proceedings portal. Officers conduct hearings from their official desktops using dedicated email IDs, while Dealing Assistants manage document uploads, notices, and status updates. Proceedings are recorded, daily order sheets are prepared and shared with parties, documents are filed electronically, adjournments are restricted, and final orders are issued within prescribed timelines."
"Under what circumstances can an ex-parte order be passed under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act, and how can such an order be set aside?","Ex-parte orders under Section 7A may be passed where a required party fails to attend the inquiry or comply with directions without valid reason, provided due service of notice is confirmed. Such orders must be reasoned, fair, and based on evidence on record. An employer may apply within three months to set aside an ex-parte order by showing non-service of notice or sufficient cause for non-appearance, subject to statutory limitations."
"What is the scope, procedure, and limitations of review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act?","Review under Section 7B of the EPF & MP Act is a limited power available against orders passed under Section 7A where no appeal has been preferred. Review may be sought on discovery of new and important evidence, error apparent on the face of the record, or other sufficient reasons strictly construed. Prior hierarchical approval is required before exercising review powers, notice to parties is mandatory, and a review cannot operate as an appeal in disguise."
What are the mandatory components and structure of a speaking order issued under Section 7A of the EPF & MP Act?,"Orders issued under Section 7A must be speaking orders containing not only conclusions and directions but also detailed reasons. An indicative structure includes background of the inquiry, appearance of parties, records produced, submissions of the establishment, department, and complainant, deliberations recorded in daily order sheets, relevant rule provisions, analysis of facts and evidence vis-a-vis rules, findings on each issue, and the final order with month-wise determination of dues and residual amount payable. Such orders must be uploaded on the e-Proceedings portal and are part of the public domain. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"
